            science fiction created by Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon for the
            Night Programming Block Adult Swim, aired on Cartoon Network. The
            series premiered on 2 December 2013 and follows the dangerous
            adventures of the scientist alcoholic Rick and his grandson Morty,
            who split their time between life family and interdimensional

            In 2016, its first two seasons were released on Netflix with
            Brazilian dubbing performed by Dubbing Company studio, from
            Campinas, with translation of Carlos Freires, and was also broadcast
            on paid channels TBS, I.Sat and TNT Séries, is currently shown in
            Brazil by the Warner channel Channel since May 4, 2020 with the
            debut of the Adult Swim block no channel. In August 2015, Adult Swim
            renewed the series for a 10-episode third season, which premiered on
            April 1, 2017 with the rest of the season scheduled to air during
            the summer of the same year.

            The series originated from an animated parody on short film from the
            movie Back to the Future created by Roiland for the Channel 101 film
            festival. Adult Swim approached Harmon about about ideas for a
            television show, so he and Roiland developed the program based on
            the short, replacing the characters of Doc with Rick and Marty with
            Morty.
          </p>

            the sixth season premiered on September 4, 2022 and consists of ten
            episodes.

            One Season seven confirmed as part of a long-term contract deadline
            with Cartoon Network who ordered 70 new episodes, which renewed the
            series until the tenth season.
          </p>
          <p>
            Adult Swim has severed ties with Roiland in 2023 amid allegations of
            domestic violence and announced that he would recast his roles.
